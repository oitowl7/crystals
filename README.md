# CRYSTAL CATS
### *HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT #4:* **Click the Cat Because *CATS!!!!**

[Link to Gitpages](https://oitowl7.github.io/crystals/)

This assignment was done to hammer home jQuery and basic JavaScript concepts. The assignment was to create a "Random Crystal" game (with cats because internet) in which the user clicks on a cat and a random value assigned to that cat is added onto the user's score. If the user's score equals the target score the user is trying to get to, they **WIN** (nothing) and if they go over the target score, they **LOSE**.

## Technologies Used
This was my introduction to jQuery library. I also used bits of vanilla JavaScript that probably could have handled events or functions that jQuery could have better done, but at the time I didn't fully understand what the difference between the two were. 

I also used custom and Boostrap CSS as well as regular old HTML5

## Lessons Learned
This was my first foray into jQuery, just as the *Hangman/Chopman Game* was my first foray into vanilla JavaScript. This was when I began learning the distinction between jQuery syntax and vanilla JS syntax...a battle that I still fight from time to time today. Figuring out how to properly make an on-click event happen was a real challenge due to the fact that I was using both the jQuery library commands and vanilla JS commands.

This was also the first time I ventured into passing attributes in functions. It was very infrequent and I still used far too many global variables, but as a first attempt at using properly scoped variables...it was **mind blowing**

This was also my first attempt at using a *Random Number Generator*. It is actually the place I go every single time I have to use an RNG because it was done simply and correctly and it is always easy to find.

## Issues
This project had very few issues. It wasn't meant to necessarily test my ability to solve millions of complex problems. It was designed to hammer home a lot of DOM editing methods and, in that sense, it very much accomplished it's goal.

## Images of the Page
This is what the page looks like. Notice the not at all gaudy wallpaper-style background, non-clashing div colors, and incredible css layouts. But most importantly, notice how adorable all those cats are. I mean seriously...just **look** at them.
